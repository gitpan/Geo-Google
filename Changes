        - Google switched their Maps server response from XML
            to JSON.  Changed the Geo::Google response parsing
            from XML to google's JSON data structure.
        - changed the toString() functions of these objects to
            toXML() functions:
               Geo::Google::Location
               Geo::Google::Segment
               Geo::Google::Path
	- Added a toJSON() function to these objects:
               Geo::Google::Location
               Geo::Google::Path
        - Added private function _JSONRenderSkeleton() to support
            the new toJSON() functions of location and path objects
        - Simplified control loops for directions segment parsing
        - Added support for waypoints in directions queries and
            Geo::Google::Path objects
        - Updated the test script
        - Added the levels() and panel() methods of the 
	    Geo::Google::Path object to allow JSON rendering that 
	    should be interchangeable with Google Maps' JSON response
        - Added a locations() method of the Geo::Google::Path
            object, allowing you to access any array of all 
	    locations used in the directions query after it has 
	    been executed
	- Expanded error handling to include more checks during the 
	    query process, added new error messages, and re-wrote 
	    some existing error messages for clarity
	- Added detailed test failure reporting to t/Geo-Google.t
