0.01  Mon May 23 22:05:45 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-Xn Geo::Google
0.03  Sun Jan 7 10:21:00 2007
        - Google switched their Maps server response from XML
            to JSON.  Changed the Geo::Google response parsing
            from XML to google's JSON data structure.
        - changed the toString() functions of these objects to
            toXML() functions:
               Geo::Google::Location
               Geo::Google::Segment
               Geo::Google::Path
	- Added a toJSON() function to these objects:
               Geo::Google::Location
               Geo::Google::Path
        - Added private function _JSONRenderSkeleton() to support
            the new toJSON() functions of location and path objects
        - Simplified control loops for directions segment parsing
        - Added support for waypoints in directions queries and
            Geo::Google::Path objects
        - Updated the test script
        - Added the levels() and panel() methods of the 
	    Geo::Google::Path object to allow JSON rendering that 
	    should be interchangeable with Google Maps' JSON response
        - Added a locations() method of the Geo::Google::Path
            object, allowing you to access any array of all 
	    locations used in the directions query after it has 
	    been executed
	- Expanded error handling to include more checks during the 
	    query process, added new error messages, and re-wrote 
	    some existing error messages for clarity
	- Added detailed test failure reporting to t/Geo-Google.t
20070226:0213:MAT 
	Partial fix of a bug in extraction and correlation of 
	driving directions steps.
20070227:0516:MAT 
	-Completed fix of Path segments bug reported by
		Thomas Delaet and Pieter-Jan Speelmans
	-Added code to automatically accept suggested changes
		to google maps queries in the Geo::Google->path() 
		function.
	-Adjusted path object to include start, stop and all 
		waypoints as segments
	-Revised test script to reflect new path data structure
20070301:0458:MAT
	-Cleaned up suggestion acceptor in Geo::Google->path()
		-Based parsing on a style tag instead of English text 
	-Replaced parsing for html segment descriptions with 
		a description constructor for waypoints only 
20070302:1422:MAT
	-Removed waypoint html segment description contstructor.
		Replaced it with the official Google title of the 
		location from from the Geo::Google::Location object
		for the waypoint.
20070304:1751:MAT
	-Fixed parsing bug that caused directions with no waypoints
		to miss all directions steps, returning only the 
		start and stop points.

		Special thanks to Pieter Agten <pi8 at pi.be>
		for zeroing in on the problem line and sending a 
		patch.
	-Added 14 new tests to verify that directions with no 
		waypoints (from: to:) parse correctly.
20070308:0626:MAT
	-re-tooled driving directions parsing and adjusted structure 
		of the path object slightly to comply with Google's 
		latest changes to the JSON data.  Added a second
		polyline (because google switched to one polyline per 
		subpath)
		-Thanks to Pieter Agten for spotting this and sending
		 in a bug report
0.04-rc1 : 9 April 2007 : MAT
    -Fixed broken distance and time parsing
    -Re-wrote and added extensive commenting to the polyline decoding
    	- now it works on 64-bit perl as well
    -Adjusted HTML segment to polyline points synchronization loops
     to account for the new polyline decoding algorithm
0.04-rc2 : MAT : adjusted for slightly different point lat/longs in test script
0.04-rc3 : MAT
  - This version requires perl JSON module 1.11 patched with Allen Day's
      JSON/Parser.pm patch.  Recently added JSON from Google Maps broke 
      the JSON parser.  The Allen Day patch makes it more flexible for
      quote handling.
  - Adjusted the _obj2location() function because Google changed their
      JSON data structure for locations (address lines specifically).
0.04-rc4: MAT
  - Rewrote _encode() for 64 bit CPU compatibility
  - Wrote _encode_word() function used by new version of _encode()
  - Fixed Geo::Google::Path->toXML() function (have not tested for KML file
    compatibility).
  - Added static unit tests for:
    _encode_word()
    _encode()
    _decode_word()
    _decode()
    _decode() to _encode() and comparison of output against input
  - Added a dynamic unit test that tests both _decode() and _encode() against
    the actual Google polyline string
  - Adjusted the correlation algorithm for HTML extracted directions segments and
    points extracted from the polyline strings.  We now use search locations for
    points wherever possible.
    - To make this possible, I adjusted precision of lat/long coords for 
      Geo::Google::Locations that are used as path search parameters.  They come
      from Google with millionth degree precision, but polyline points only have
      hundred-thousandth degree precision.
    - Points to HTML correlation is spot on for point-to-point directions, but off
      for point-to-point-to-point directions (waypoints).  Will fix this when I
      restructure the API for Path->Subpath->Segment directions structure.
  - Adjusted directions parsing to accommodate Google's naming convention change
    for driving segments.  It was 'dirsegment_\d+_\d+', but now it's 
    'panel_\d+_\d+'.
0.04-rc5 (MAT)
  - Modified the location() constructor method of of the Geo::Google object to
    allow it to return Geo::Gooogle::Location objects when Google can't resolve
    the address you provide but suggests alternate addresses that it can
    resolve.  It returns these alternate address in the same array of
    Geo::Google::Location objects that it normally returns.  They are ordered 
    in the same order Google presents them.
  - Added unit tests for handling of suggested alternate addresses in the
    location() constructor method of the Geo::Google object.
0.04-rc5 (MAT)
  - Modified Makefile.PL to require JSON version 1.12 or greater (1.11 and
    earlier don't handle mixes of ' and " as key and field delimiters)
0.04-rc6 (MAT)
  - Adjusted parsing to compensate for a in change Google's JSON reponse
    structure and UTF escaping.
  - Minor code beautification
  - Adjusted test script to match slight changes in Google's data
  - Test script now prints specific error messages when it fails some tests
0.05-rc1 (MAT)
  - Updated total directions length parsing to reflect Google's recent 
    display format change
  - Re-wrote test script to only test lat/long of Geo::Google::Location objects
    that don't come from a polyline to the nearest hundred-thousandth of a
    degree.  In most cases, this difference is a matter of inches on the ground.
      - Should prevent needless test script changes every time Google gets
	a database update from Navteq
